Solar térmica: SOLAR ENERGY EQUIPMENT FOR YOUR HOME
Las energías renovables constituyen: Renewable energy is one of the most important factors in the energy supply, making it possible to meet the needs of any family or business. Solar energy is an inexhaustible and free natural resource which allows for the personal consumption of thermal and electric energy by using systems designed for that purpose.
Los sistemas de energía solar térmica: iEDES Solenergy’s forced circulation solar thermal energy systems are capable of meeting all the basic domestic hot water (DHW) needs in single-family homes, businesses, and in the vast majority of circumstances that require a DHW supply.
¿Cómo funciona solar térmico?: HOW DOES SOLAR THERMAL ENERGY EQUIPMENT WORK?
Esta instalación solar térmica: This solar thermal system will be responsible for transferring calorific energy provided by solar radiation to a heat transfer fluid that is found in the primary circuit of the installation in order to obtain domestic hot water (DHW) to supply to the home. This system is made up of three very different parts
Circuito primario de captación: Primary Sensor Circuit (C). Closed circuit comprised of a combination of solar sensors connected in an order such that the heat transfer fluid circulates in order to transfer the captured heat from the panels to the water stored in the collector, through a helical heat exchanger. 
Acumulador (B): Collector (B). The accumulated water will serve as a transfer element between the primary circuit and the consumption circuit. It produces heat transfer between the two, and this heat will vertically stratify in a way that produces the main heat transfer for the DHW consumption (G-) < (F+).
Circuito de consumo (ACS): Consumption Circuit (DHW). Produces an instant heat transfer between the stored water in the collector and the DHW for consumption. The network water enters (A) and circulates through the helical heat exchanger where it reaches the temperature necessary to meet the needs of the of the customer who will be using it (E).
El agua fría entra: The cold water enters through an opening (A) in an isolated holding tank (B). From there it flows through a panel (C), which absorbs the solar radiation (D). The solar energy is absorbed in the form of heat and the hot water returns to the tank where it exchanges heat with the rest of the water through convection or a heat exchanger. The hot water leaves the tank from the top where it can be used (E). The temperature of the top of the tank (F +) is more than in the bottom (G-) due to the lower specific mass of hotter water.
Los captadores solares: The iEDES Solenergy solar sensors are developed for thermal use at low temperatures. They are designed to withstand the harshest weather conditions. The most advanced materials are used in their construction with the aim of obtaining a long lifespan and the maximum energy output.

EQUIPOS DE ENERGÍA SOLAR FOTOVOLTAICA: PHOTOVOLTAIC SOLAR ENERGY EQUIPMENT

CÓMO FUNCIONA UN EQUIPO DE ENERGÍA SOLAR FOTOVOLTAICA: HOW DOES PHOTOVOLTAIC SOLAR ENERGY EQUIPMENT WORK?
Las instalaciones fotovoltaicas se dividen: Photovoltaic systems are divided into two main groups
Instalaciones aisladas: Isolated (off-grid) systems. These are systems which power is not available in the home, or when independence from large electric companies is desired. In these systems, the energy produced is stored in electric accumulators (batteries) for later use.
Instalaciones de autoconsumo: Personal use (grid-tied) systems. Systems that combine photovoltaic electricity production with the power supply of large companies. These are different from the former due to the fact that they are not made with any type of storage element, which is why the energy produced must be consumed directly.
En ambos casos el funcionamiento: In both cases, the operation of the installation is based on the conversion of solar energy that the photovoltaic panels collect, this energy is transmitted (in the case of isolated systems) to a regulatory system that is in charge of controlling the charging and discharging cycles of the batteries in order to manage and protect them. Afterwards, the energy stored in the batteries will be managed by the installation’s inverter, thus converting the continuous current provided by the batteries to an alternating current adapted for use in the electrical system of the home. In the case of personal use systems, batteries are done away with, passing the continuous current produced by the panels directly to the inverter, where it is transformed and consumed instantly.

The only requirements are that the proposed alternative consumes the same or less energy and generates the same or less CO2 emissions as the standard solar system and its equipment.
La principal ventaja, es el ahorro energético: The main advantage is energy savings. In a home, this translates directly to economic savings. Said savings can mean up to 75% when compared to a conventional electric water heater. However, it’s necessary to know the consumption of each home.
